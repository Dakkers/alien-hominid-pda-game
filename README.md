Alien Hominid PDA Minigame
==========================
this is a re-creation of Alien Hominid's PDA minigame for modern browsers. Alien Hominid was originally a Flash game on Newgrounds, and then it was ported to the Gamecube, Xbox, PS2, Gameboy Advance, and more recently, Xbox Live Arcade. the PDA minigame was not part of the original game; it was created for consoles.

re-created by Jacky Ngai (art) and Dakota St. Laurent (programming) at Treetu's first hackathon at the University of Waterloo, using NodeJS/Express, the HTML5 game framework [MelonJS](http://melonjs.org/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/).
